            <p> Welcome to my page! </p>
            <p> I'm taking my first steps into the amazing world of Frontend, so please don't judge too harshly :) Constructive criticism is welcome!  </p>
            <p> Once upon a time... in search of a hobby in my spare time (from may main job as well as from my family, husband, three children, their endless circles, and a cat), I happened to stumble upon tutorials on creating websites. This is how it all started ... Stay turned :) </p>
            <p> Before that it was a mystery to me how and what works in web programming, but obviously this is all very difficult and painful. What was my surprise when, almost from the first lesson (but after I thoroughly suffered with installing special programs for writing code (hello, VS Code and Sublime Text), and in general, having familiarized myself with what happens), I started get the simplest sites! So, the magic as it was still remains. It's still amazing to me how it works, why after writing HTML code and adding styles, browser understands me and follows my orders! Wow!)</p>

        <h2><a name="opyt"></a>Experience </h2>
        <p> I am currently working as a trademark attorney. During my work, I'm mastered the art of conveying information to the client in a concise form, in a digestible state, briefly reporting the main problems and solutions, whether it is a Russian client or a foreign one. </p>
        <p> Business correspondence and communication in Russian and English in the field of law, with foreign companies, as well as Russian customs services and departments of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, allowed me to develop resistance to various situations and quickly search for various ways to resolve problems that arose. </p>
        <p> Working with documents pumped the skill to pay attention to the smallest details and nuances from the first reading)) </p>
        <p> And of course, don't forget remote work for the past eight years, it also proves a high level of self-organization and discipline, the ability to work independently and make decisions based on my own experience. At the same time, in any case, working in a company involves frequent interaction with colleagues, for mutual assistance and joint resolution of current affairs.</p>
